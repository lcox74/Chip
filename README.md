# Chip

A study on how terminal based text editors work. Following the 
[Kilo](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) project for 
the base design before applying my own changes.


## The Plan

Chip is going to be designed for C development, I want to be
able to add custom macros to help speed development. Vim is going
to be the main source of inspiration.
